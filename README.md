# Data Visualizations

This is a personal repository for visual experiments using code.

The visualizations are built mainly with Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) and JavaScript (D3.js). Most of them are based on small questions or comparisons that I wanted to explore through charts.

## Contents

- Python notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- D3.js sketches (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Datasets used or created during the process

## Tools

- Python
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - plotly
- JavaScript
  - D3.js

## Notes

This is a work in progress.
